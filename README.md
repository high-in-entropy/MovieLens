# MovieLens
## This repository aims at implementing data analytics to a MovieLens data.
This code implements a few functionalities of pandas, mostly dealing with the treatment of a tabular data. Analytics is done by the code, however, its interpretation is left to the reader. We can discuss the interpretations in the comments below the code. Thank You!
(Also you can visit the webasite where the dataset is available here http://www.grouplens.org/node/73)
